## Content Plan Title: Jamstack for Wordpress Developers 


## Description
This is a 1-month content plan aimed at introducing wordpress developers that are curious about Jamstack and how they can get started with it.

## Persona

The purpose of a persona is to have an example of the kind of people the content we are producing in this sprint is for. 

Note: This persona is fictional and is not an actual person

## Persona name 

Mike

## Persona description
 
Mike is a wordpress developer with about 10 years of experience building web platforms with wordpress. He is an avid reader wpbeginner which is one of the most popular blogs for all things wordpress and loves to read up on wordpress tips and tricks. While scrolling through social media(Twitter) Mike came across the word JAMstack which he has been seeing a lot of web developers talk about. He is interested in it and would like to learn more about how it can be valuable to him as a wordpress developer.
Goal
The goal of this plan is to make a content plan for developers like Mike that are curious about Jamstack and want to know more about it. This content should be able to make the audience want to read more content from us. 

The plan is to create a 1-month content schedule with new content weekly.

**Why weekly?**

The point of releasing a single blog post per week is to make sure we give readers time to digest the content we have created and also to carry out proper distribution of the content.

Each week will consist of writing and publishing the blog post, figuring out the best method to distribute it further for more views, social media advertisement of that particular blog post, and also answering questions from the audience

| 2    | Jamstack for Wordpress Developers                  | In this blog post, I’ll do a comparison between jamstack and wordpress. I’ll also talk about reasons why jamstack may be better and more modern than wordpress. I’ll also talk about the experiences of teams that have migrated from wordpress to JAMstack and the benefits they’ve gotten. Finally, I’ll talk about existing issues that wordpress has and how Jamstack fixes that (SEO, Security). |
| 3    | Migrating from Wordpress to Jamstack               | In this blog post, I’ll explain a series of steps to take when considering migrating to Jamstack from wordpress. I’ll also highlight wordpress alternatives in the Jamstack ecosystem to use including prismic(this will lead to a follow-up blog post in the next week), possible errors that could be encountered, and how to fix them.                                                             |

## Keywords to target when writing content
This is a list of specific keywords that should be in the blog post we write, mainly for SEO benefits.

- Jamstack
- Wordpress alternative
- Static Site Generators, SSG
- Server Side Rendering
- CMS, Content Management System
- Modern
- Affordable
- Faster/Speed
- Developer Experience
- Headless CMS
- Javascript, etc.

### Differentiating Our Content from existing content on the internet
We need to be practical in our blog post by talking about real-world usage and benefits. We should not aim to sell the idea of jamstack to the audience, instead, we should focus on getting the audience to understand what jamstack is and its importance. We should also give user stories, for example how company x was able to migrate from wordpress to using Prismic, how it improved things for them, how easy it was, and problems they encountered. 

Another way to do this is to have a different style of writing from existing content like using infographics in our content, gifs, etc. we should make reading fun for the audience and make our content very interactive.


## Distribution Method

### Goals 
- Generate interest from wordpress developers
- Generate awareness
- Extract engagement

To pick the right social media channels that help us reach our target audience and help promote our content. 

As a first step, we need to measure our reach. Part of this is to set up a few channels and measure what we are able to achieve and then set gradually increasing limits and expanding our reach. For the first few iterations, the recommendation is to not assign any budget/marketing dollars for promotion. The idea is to leverage our owned and earned media before proceeding to use our budgets (social media ads). 

### Steps to take
- Create a content calendar. (1 month ahead) ✅
- Add annexes/appendices/follow up posts.
- Drive traffic via Twitter (Prismic/personal).
- Post information to relevant social media platforms.
- Measure traffic and engagement from these efforts.
- Identify any newsletters or 3rd party content aggregators with a large audience and share links there
- Eat. Sleep. Recalibrate. Repeat.♻️

## The Overall spread of distribution channels

| Immediate | Medium Term   | Long Term                              |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Medium    | Hackernoon    | 3rd-party content aggregators(bylines) |
| Twitter   | Dev.to        | Company Blog                           |
| Reddit    | Hacker News   |                                        |
|           | LinkedIn      |                                        |
|           | Newsletters   |                                        |
|           | Company Slack |                                        |
|           | Hashnode      |                                        |


## Success

Metrics can be slippery and inaccurate but if we dismiss them, we are selling ourselves short. Defining success for blog posts can be a hassle but it is important to understand that once you have your target audience engaging with your content, it has fulfilled its purpose and that content can be in a way said to be “successful”.

For this content plan, success can be based on the following:

- Blog views and Clicks
- Page views increase for Prismic.io
- Positive comments on the Blog posts
- Retweets and Positive Quoted tweets(Twitter)
- Positive Feedback from the community in general
- Reposts from the Community
- Migration from wordpress to Jamstack (user stories)

## Content Retrospective With Team 

The purpose of a retrospective is for the general team to talk about what they liked from the content that was produced, what they learned during content production or after, and finally what they think we should discuss.

This will be weekly, based on the content released that week, and will be done at the end of each content week (Friday).

The table below will be filled by each person on the team and will also be used in the meeting for discussions.
